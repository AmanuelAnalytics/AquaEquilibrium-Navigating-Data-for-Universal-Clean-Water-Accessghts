# AquaEquilibrium-Navigating-Data-for-Universal-Clean-Water-Access

## Introduction

Welcome to the "AquaEquilibrium-Navigating-Data-for-Universal-Clean-Water-Access" project, an exploration into Sustainable Development Goal 6 - ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. As I tackle global challenges related to climate change and water scarcity, my focus lies in understanding and addressing the disparities in access to clean water.

## Project Overview

### Understanding the Data

My journey begins by unraveling data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene spanning the years 2000 to 2020. I aim to unearth inequalities in service levels across various countries and regions, using service ladders to benchmark access to drinking water.

### Transforming the Data

To accomplish my goals, I'll import and clean data, create new features, and visualize the results. The dataset classifies access to drinking water into five service levels, ranging from safely managed to surface water.

## WHO/UNICEF JMP Data Overview

### Estimations (2000 - 2020)

- **Country or Area:** Specific country or area for the estimated values.
- **Year:** The year for which the values are estimated.
- **Population:** Estimated population size in thousands.
- **% Urban:** Estimated percentage of the population living in urban areas.
- **Service Levels:** National, rural, and urban percentage share of access to drinking water services.

### Service Levels

- **Safely Managed:** Drinking water free from contamination and accessible on premises.
- **Basic:** Drinking water from an improved source with a collection time not exceeding 30 minutes.
- **Limited:** Drinking water from an improved source with a collection time exceeding 30 minutes.
- **Unimproved:** Drinking water from an unprotected dug well or spring.
- **Surface Water:** Drinking water directly from a natural water source.

## Project Tasks

### Key Tasks

1. **World Population Insights:**
   - Examine world population estimates in comparison to the dataset populations.

2. **Urban vs. Rural Dynamics:**
   - Analyze the urban vs. rural population shares, uncovering nuances in water access.

3. **Tendencies and Spreads:**
   - Examine tendencies and spreads of different water access features.

4. **Cross-sectional Analysis:**
   - Compare water access measures across different types of areas.

5. **Access in Proportion to Population:**
   - Investigate national, urban, and rural access based on population size.

### Connecting the Dots

The insights gained from Part One lay the groundwork for my continued exploration in Part Two.

## Continuing the Journey - Part Two

### Key Tasks

6. **Comparing Datasets:**
   - Explore the differences between the imported dataset and the Estimates on the use of water (2020) dataset.

7. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - Identify represented years within the dataset, calculating the average year difference per country.

8. **Annual Rates Change (ARC):**
   - Determine the ARC for national, rural, and urban areas, exploring average changes across different countries.

9. **Temporal Evolution of Water Access:**
   - Examine how access to basic water changes over time for different areas.

10. **Comparative Analysis:**
    - Compare ARCs between rural and urban populations, across different regions, and understand the influence of national population size on the ARC.
